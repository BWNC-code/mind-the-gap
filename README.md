# MIND THE GAP

## Introduction
Mind the Gap aims to alert people to the unbalanced approach the medical and pharmaceutical industries have towards womens vs mens healthcare. The site is intended to educate people on what assumptions are made which are harmful, and highlight conditions and treatment they might otherwise be ignorant of. This inital draft of the site will contain the broad message as well as another page on a specific condition as an example to build on in future.
There will also be an area to submit stories to be posted to the site at a later date.
