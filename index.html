        </div>
        <div class="center-info">
            <p>The reasons behind why there is a gender gap in healthcare are difficult to pin down, as they stem from
                an array of social, cultural, economic and psychological issues
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="center-info">
            <p>However, there is one <strong>flawed</strong> assumption that forms the basis of modern medicine and
                healthcare that we
                can attribute the gender gap to:

                <p>Research carried out in male participants can be extrapolated to women i.e. if it works for men, it

            <h3>The Reality</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="center-info">
            <p>There are several physiological differences between the sexes, ranging from chromosomes to lung capacity
                to hormones to reproductive systems
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="center-info">
            <p>By assuming male and female anatomy are equal, and taking into consideration social and cultural biases
                during the birth of western medicine, clinical and scientific research to date has primarily been based
                on male anatomy and the male body's response to medications

            <h3>The Main Issues</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="center-list">
            <ol>
                <li>In conditions that affect both sexes, symptoms that may present differently in women as compared to
                    men are largely ignored or dismissed as HCPs are only taught to recognise typically male-presenting
                    symptoms
                </li>
                <li>Side effects for approved medications are male-specific, leading many women to believe that side
                    effects they experience are either psychological or unrelated to the medication, which can lead to
                    more severe consequences if the medication continues to be taken
                </li>
                <li>Sex-specific health issues, such as reproductive health disorders, take a backseat to other
                    non-sex-specific conditions in clinical research and HCP/public education, leaving many women with
                    long diagnostic odysseys and few treatment options
                    <ul>
                        <li>This applies to male reproductive health disorders as well, but due to anatomical
                            differences (monthly menstrual cycles, pregnancy, shorter urinary tracts) the prevalence and
                            severity/impact on life of these disorders are much higher for women
                        </li>
