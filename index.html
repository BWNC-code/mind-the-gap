                In conditions that affect both sexes, <strong>men are investigated and treated more extensively than
                    women</strong> with the same severity of symptoms

            <p>
                In studies where the number of patients and the severity of the disease did not differ between men and
                women, <strong>there was far more expenditure for clinic-based treatment for male patients</strong>

                In a retrospective study of intensive care use, <strong>women were less likely than men to be admitted

        <div class="center-info">
            <p>The reasons behind why there is a gender gap in healthcare are difficult to pin down, as they stem from
                an array of social, cultural, economic and psychological issues
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="center-info">
            <p>However, there is one <strong>flawed</strong> assumption that forms the basis of modern medicine and
                healthcare that we
                can attribute the gender gap to:

                <p>Research carried out in male participants can be extrapolated to women i.e. if it works for men, it
                    should work for women</p>

        <div class="center-info">
            <p>There are several physiological differences between the sexes, ranging from chromosomes to lung capacity
                to hormones to reproductive systems

        </div>
        <div class="center-info">
            <p>By assuming male and female anatomy are equal, and taking into consideration social and cultural biases
                during the birth of western medicine, clinical and scientific research to date has primarily been based
                on male anatomy and the male bodyâ€™s response to medications
